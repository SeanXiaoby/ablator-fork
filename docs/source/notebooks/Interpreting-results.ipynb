    "In an HPO process, hyperparameters are randomly selected for each trial from a predefined search space, using algorithms such as 'random' or 'TPE' to generate values. When TPE is used ablation experiments can be biased towards a specific hyper-parameter range. For example, for different random initialization of TPE, it randomly sampled a higher learning rate for which smaller network (fewer channels) performed better. The contrary results were obtained using TPE where a random initialization sampled from smaller learning rates, favoring a larger neural network (more channels). \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, it appears we get contradictory conclusions for our Ablation experiments. We NOTE, that it is important to select a Random strategy when performing ablation experiments where we want to be definite about the performance of a method. For example, using a Random optimization strategy have us conclude that using XXX performs better. \n",
    "\n",
    "When exploring the correlations, the resulting plots can provide insights into how the hyperparameters interact when used simultaneously. The plots reveal trends and patterns that can help understand the combined effect of the hyperparameters on the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If significant correlations are found among the hyperparameters, it may be beneficial to conduct HPO on individual hyperparameters to gain a deeper understanding of their independent effects. This focused analysis allows for a more precise evaluation of each hyperparameter's influence on the model's performance."
